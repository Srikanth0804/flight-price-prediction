# flight-price-prediction
End-to-end machine learning project for flight ticket price prediction with Streamlit deployment

✈️ **Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

End-to-end regression project with deployment using Streamlit

📌 **Project Overview**

This project is a machine learning–based web application designed to predict flight ticket prices based on various travel-related features such as airline, number of stops, journey duration, departure time, and arrival time.

The objective is to simulate a real-world ML workflow by covering the complete lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using Streamlit.

The model has been deployed for interactive use on Hugging Face Spaces, enabling real-time predictions.

🎯 **Objective**

To build an accurate regression model that predicts airfare prices and helps users understand how multiple travel factors impact ticket pricing.
